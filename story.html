  <h2>Beginning</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Sachin Chouhan. I come from a Hindi medium background where resources are limited, but dreams are limitless. From the very beginning of my academic life, I realized that success would require discipline, patience, and consistency. I chose to believe in hard work rather than shortcuts.
  </p>  <h2>Struggles & Discipline</h2>
  <p>
    Preparing for IIT is not easy. Long study hours, repeated failures, and self-doubt became part of my journey. Instead of giving up, I trained my mind to stay focused. Discipline became my strength, and consistency became my habit. Every failure taught me something new.
  </p>  <h2>Learning & Technology</h2>
  <p>
    Along with academics, I developed interest in technology. Learning programming languages like Python and Java improved my logical thinking and problem-solving ability. Coding taught me that even the hardest problems can be solved step by step with patience.
  </p>  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <p>
    My goal is to become an IITian and a skilled engineer who contributes positively to society. I want to inspire students who come from backgrounds like mine and show them that determination can defeat any limitation. This story is not the end; it is only the beginning.
