  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Sachin Chouhan. I am a Class 12 MP Board student from a Hindi medium background, driven by a strong determination to become an IITian. I firmly believe that success is not dependent on background, language, or resources, but on mindset, discipline, and consistency. From an early stage of my academic journey, I decided that I would dedicate my life to learning, self-growth, and excellence.

  <h2>My Complete Life Story</h2>
  <p>
    I was born with dreams far bigger than my surroundings. Coming from a Hindi medium background, the path toward competitive exams and advanced education was never easy. Limited resources, lack of guidance, and constant comparison created many obstacles, but I never allowed these challenges to define my limits. Instead, they shaped my character and strengthened my resolve.
    <br><br>
    My daily routine is built on discipline. I wake up early, study for long hours, revise consistently, and analyze my mistakes honestly. Preparing for IIT is not only about mastering physics, chemistry, and mathematics; it is about building patience, mental toughness, and faith in long-term effort. I believe that consistency beats motivation, and discipline beats talent when talent does not work hard.
    <br><br>
    Failure has been an important teacher in my journey. There were times when test scores were low and confidence was shaken. Instead of giving up, I chose to learn from every mistake. I improved my strategy, strengthened my weak areas, and moved forward with renewed focus. Each setback became a lesson, not a stopping point.
    <br><br>
    Technology plays a vital role in my life. Learning programming languages like Python and Java has trained my mind to think logically and systematically. Coding taught me that even the most complex problems can be solved when broken down into smaller, manageable steps. This mindset helps me not only in programming, but also in academics and real-life challenges.
    <br><br>
    Along with studies, I am deeply passionate about motivation and self-improvement. I like to inspire students who feel lost, weak, or afraid of competition. I strongly believe that every student has immense potential, and with the right mindset and guidance, anyone can rise above limitations. My goal is to grow as a learner and help others grow alongside me.
    <br><br>
    My ultimate aim is to crack IIT and become a skilled engineer who contributes positively to society. I do not chase success for status alone; I seek knowledge, growth, and the ability to create meaningful impact. This website is a reflection of my journey, my discipline, and my belief that nothing is impossible for a focused and determined mind.
    <br><br>
    This is only the beginning of a long journey. The road is challenging, but my commitment is unbreakable. I am building myself day by day, step by step, with patience, honesty, and hard work. I am not waiting for success—I am preparing myself to deserve it.
